(selection of the name and chara design)

~~name~~ = player name;

10 years ago:

The world was in shambles; a great war opposed the great spirits. The Spirit of Light and the Spirit of Time armies were facing off against each other and it was regular for the world to be light-less or to be timeless. Born during the spirit war; *name* was like some other kids; a human born of both timeless shape and a light-less spirit. Like all other kids, it allowed him to radiate an aura capable of moving while time was stopped or see while light was off. Yet unlike any other, ~~name~~ never awakened these abilities, making him nothing but a normal human. The war raged over the world for 5 more years killing many innocent in the process until both light and time became regular again: the spirit had lost their powers for unknown reasons.

**This part should serve as a tutorial for the player to learn the control and as an introduction to the main story line**

Nowadays:

Everyone took back a normal life and no light or time struggles had ever appeared.

In ~~name~~ house:

~~Name~~, you don't know it, but you are one of those radiant kids. In the light sanctuary is the lantern that allows kids like you to radiate more than they should. **Go and take it before father dies.**

**First quest: go to the light sanctuary and get the lantern your father was talking about.**

At the light sanctuary:

Gameplay part blah blah blah.

After ~~name~~ pick up the lantern:

The lantern start radiating a strange light; ~~name~~ absorbing it all; due to being the nearest human. As ~~name~~ is absorbing the light; the light army came in the temple and realized he has absorbed it. The moment they tried to call him out; light went off and time was stopped. Everyone was froze in time yet; the light was still radiating from name. His inner abilities awoken due to the lantern and allowed him to radiate a light in which time was on. As he realized that; name went out of the sanctuary and saw something he would have never expected to see again; a fully black world in which everyone; even radiant kids were frozen in time.
